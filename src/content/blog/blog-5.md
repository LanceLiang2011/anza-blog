My wonderfully supportive cousin Sara, told me “that we can still do this, we will find a way”.
We started to brainstorm how I could accomplish this dream.
<br />
<br />
I remembered that I had one course to take in college to get my Diploma in Business
Administration – Accounting. It had been some time since I had been to college but I
decided to try and see what happened. I called my college to find out how and if it was still
possible to get my diploma for the program that I took over 20 years ago. I figured I could at
least finish something in life. I hope that getting my diploma would get me closer to going to
South Korea and maybe from there onto other countries to teach English as well.
<br />
<br />
Finally, one small piece of success, I was able to register to take my final class to obtain my
diploma but I still hadn’t worked out how to move forward from there to follow my dreams. I
knew there were other countries with less stringent requirements but my heart had settled
on South Korea for the first part of my journey. It felt right.
<br />
<br />

With my determination to make South Korea my first stop and to keep my flagging hopes alive, I decided to learn Hangul and my cousin decided to make this her new things she did for the year. Languages does not come easily to either of us so we started with some private lessons from Joohe (Judy) to learn the alphabet and get some of the basics down.
<br />
<br />
In my brand new journal, I wrote out a to do list to get to South Korea and this was the top of it as this was something I could do. Each lesson we diligently applied ourselves. I wrote out the alphabet as we learned it and we practised. Joohe was most patient and it was novel to learn a language over 60 minute zoom lessons. Joohe made the time fly by and after several weeks we had the alphabet and some basic words down like chijeu is cheese, keopi is coffee which is written like 커피 in Hangul.

Taking these little actions started to bring me out of my slump, a glimpse of hope!
