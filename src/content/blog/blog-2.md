I started to research other countries and what steps I needed to take to make this change and what I need to do to make it happen. I started thinking of the things I want to do or what cultures interested me. These are the type of things one does when you are in your 20s, before you start your dream career or family. But when I was younger, if you didn’t know the right people, didn’t go to the right places, you wouldn’t know this was even possible or how to go about doing something like this. Social media was still old school word of mouth or paper advertising.

I eventually landed on South Korea. There were so many things I had discovered about South Korea that were new, interesting or that I already loved like; K-pop, K-dramas, the food and the overall culture. I had visited China when I was younger and I had really enjoyed the experience. I thought this was a great way to see more of the world, Asia was huge and South Korea made an awesome place to start.

Since COVID-19 and the lockdowns, I’ve thought a lot about my life and career path and the trajectory it needed to take. Was I happy in any of the fields that I worked in so far in my career? Not recently. So I though that this might be the best time to rethink what would make me happy. Looking back to my younger years, I was always interested in teaching young children. I’d heard so much about people who have gone abroad to teach I decided to research how I can go about doing the same and if it was possible with my current level of education given I hadn’t gone to teacher’s college

Being happy about starting this new journey of mine, maybe a little too excited, I took a TEFL course with my cousin, Sara as she both supported me and enjoys learning new things. Side note on my cousin, every year she tries to do something new and for 2021, she made TEFL that new thing to try. Me personally, if I didn’t have this dream, I’m not sure this would’ve been my first choice. Since I was young, I struggled with school. It simply didn’t come easy to me. I was apprehensive the same would hold true now but at least this time, I had a buddy to go through this with along with grit and determine to make this work out.

<br />

If you’ve never done a TEFL course, it’s layout was pretty simple. We registered for a teaching certification with Teach Away. There were 5 mainstream courses and 2 optional ones that we got to select from a list. I selected Teaching Abroad and Teaching English to Koreans. Sara selected Business English and Teaching English to Koreans.
